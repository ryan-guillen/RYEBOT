## RYEBOT

A discord bot I made that will make jokes, make fun of users, adds an economy, adds a rock paper scissors game, and more.  
Made with discord.js

## Features

Answer a user's question based on a scale of 1-10  
Give a user a magic 8 ball response  
Tell a joke  
Allow users to player Rock, Paper, Scissors against each other  
Respond with a phrase when a user says "good morning"/"good night" to Ryebot  
Randomly reacts to a user's message with an emoji  

## Economy

RYEBOT adds a simple economy. Currently there is nothing to buy. The currency is called RyeCoins.  
Users have a chance to get money each time they message.  
Users can /coinflip to bet RyeCoins. There is a 50% chance that they will win or lose RyeCoins.  
You are also able to /coinflip against another player. /coinflip (amt) (other user)
Users can /diceroll to bet RyeCoins. There is a 1/6 chance to win RyeCoins.  
/leaderboard shows who has the most RyeCoins.  

Some files are in .gitignore because they contain fun secret functionality that I don't want people to find while looking
through my code. These files include /util/generateImage.js, /util/pleasantries.js, and /util/question.js.
You will have to implement these in your own way, or remove them from the code, if you want RYEBOT to work.
